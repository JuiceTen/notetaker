# notetaker

Notetaker is an app that will allow the user to create new notes that they can save and review later.

This note taker app is fully functioning and deployed live on heroku and will live in the github repository. 

All notes will live under the /api/notes section where the information will be stored using an express server, serving as our back end api. 

When the app is opened you will be sent directly to our homepage of index.html that lives in our public folder.

Once you click "get notes" you will be redirected to a /notes url and this will take you to where the note taking portion of the application where you can create and save new notes. 

In order to get this application running please clone/fork the repo and install express using npm install.
